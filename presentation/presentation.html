# What is Vibration API?

* a small and simple API for vibrating the user's phone

* Second edition, W3C recommendation 18 October 2016

---

# What can you do with it?

* Well, you can vibrate the phone. That's it.

* You can vibrate once or specify a pattern

* You can determine the length of the vibrations

* You can cancel existing vibrations

---

# Limitations

* Sadly but understandably, the vibrations only work if the user is <b>on the page</b>

* This means that if the user has their screen locked, is checking on some other app
 or even browsing on a different tab on their browser, the vibration will fail

* Wake Lock API could be helpful, but that raises the concern for battery life

# Browser support

* For some reason Chrome 64.0.3282.137 on my phone does not work with this

* Same Chrome version on the same phone model works for my friend though

* Firefox seems to work fine for me, which is all that really matters

---

# Examples

* Please check the examples <a href="../demonstration/demonstration.html">here</a>

* Short URL: http://bit.ly/2FPDuo5

* QR code with a link (just trust me!)

# Use cases

* I originally wanted to use this as an alert mechanism for my mash-up project

* The "stay on page" requirement kind of ruined that one, but it's still a possible use case

* Games are one use case for the Vibration API

---

# Security considerations

* The API makes the browser ask for permission upon the first vibration (be aware of this if your vibrations are event or time based)

* The Vibration API provides an indirect privacy risk

* Sensors such as accelometers and gyroscopes have an unique "fingerprint" due to small imperfections during the manufacturing

* The Vibration API could be utilized together with other APIs to get these unique fingerprints

* Also, a vibrating device might provide the means to physically identify users
